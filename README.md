This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## PlantSync

**PlantSync** is a group reminder system designed for managing indoor plant care. Users can log in, check the status of their plants, and ensure that their plants are properly watered. PlantSync helps prevent over- or underwatering by allowing users to notify others in their group when a plant has been watered. It also optionally tracks the growth of the plants.

The backend of this app is powered by **MongoDB Atlas**, a cloud-based modern database, to store user information and plant details. The app is deployed on **Vercel** for easy access and scalability.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
